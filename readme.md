# ville.Wax

Hooked on a feeling that a single project (codebase) can be used to build applications for multiple platforms.

## Goals

* qx.Desktop based controls that fit and function well in the web, desktop and mobile UI UX paradigms
* Multiple projects/demos/examples that fit various UI UX scenarios
* Skeleton (template) based - all projects have an associated application skeleton
