<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Hooked on a feeling that a single project (codebase) can be used to build applications for multiple platforms (the ones that matter).

**Goals**
* qx.Desktop based controls that fit and work well in the web, desktop and mobile UI UX paradigms
* Multiple projects/demos/examples that fit various UI UX scenarios
* Skeleton (template) based - all projects have an associated application skeleton

**Screen Shots**
