    One code base, all platforms for the Qooxdoo JavaScript Framework

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hooked on a feeling that a single qooxdoo project (codebase) can be used to build applications for multiple platforms (the ones that matter). Let's see where this goes.

**Goals**
* Multiple projects/demos/examples that fit various UI UX scenarios
* Skeleton (template) based - all projects have an associated qooxdoo application skeleton
